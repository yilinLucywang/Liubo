"<b>Liubo</b> is an ancient Chinese board game about birds competing over a pond full of fish. The full rules of the game were lost to time; here we present one possible reconstruction of the rules based on the surviving components and texts!
 <b>Use the menu on the left to navigate the rules topics. Within a topic, use the arrows to flip through pages.</b>"$%"This section contains the essential rules to start playing, including:
 1. How to take your turn
 2. How to score points
 3. How to win the game"$%"Here are the elements on your screen during gameplay: 
 1. Displays your <b>name and current score</b>
 2. Displays your two <b>move numbers</b> for this turn
 3. Shows or hides the <b>“helper lines”</b> indicating which spaces on the board are connected"$%<b>To start your turn, click on “Roll Sticks” at the bottom of the screen</b>. Before rolling, you can shake the jar by moving your mouse quickly! After rolling, you will see a display of the result. The game automatically interprets this result for you, and displays your two numbers underneath your player card.$%All of your birds begin the game <b>off the board</b>. Their first step onto the board must be onto one of the <b>“Branch” spaces</b> on your side of the board, which are highlighted in green.$%The connections between perches are drawn onto the diagram above. Any perches connected by blue lines in this diagram are <b>adjacent</b>. It takes 1 step of movement to move between adjacent perches.$%When a bird <b>lands on or crosses the pond</b> in the center of the board, it becomes an <b>Owl</b>. This is indicated by the piece standing up on end.$%When two of your birds share a perch, they form a <b>blockade</b>. Blockades prevent all other pieces from moving through them, <b>including your own</b>.$%When two opposing birds of the same type (both normal or both Owl) land on the same perch, that perch becomes <b>contested</b>. Both birds share the space peacefully... for now.$%There are <b>three ways to capture</b> an opponent's bird (detailed on the following pages). In all cases, the active player <b>scores points based on the type</b> (normal or Owl) of the opponent’s bird they captured. Capturing a <b>normal bird awards 1 point</b>, while capturing an <b>Owl awards 3 points</b>.$%You also score points by having your <b>Owl reach one of its nests</b>. These nest spaces are <b>circular spaces located on your opponent’s side of the board</b>. When an Owl either <b>lands on or pass through a nest space</b> during its movement, its player immediately scores <b>2 points</b>, and the <b>Owl reverts to being a normal bird</b>.$%"<b>Tip #1: Use all your birds!</b> More birds on the board means more options on every turn. However, it can also be advantageous to keep one or two off the board. This way, they can enter quickly to catch an opponent's Owl before they reach a nest!

"In <b>Liubo</b>, each player controls 6 pieces representing birds. These birds fly around the board from perch to perch (the lines on the board), trying to reach the pond in the center of the board. When a bird crosses over or lands on the pond, it catches a fish and becomes an “Owl”, also meaning “leader” of the flock."$%"Every Liubo turn consists of the following steps:
 
 <b>Step 1</b>. <b>Roll the jar of sticks</b> by clicking “Roll Sticks” to generate two numbers between 1 and 4 (see “Rolling the Sticks”)"$%"4. Shows or hides the names of positions on the board, translated from their original chinese characters
 5. Rolls the sticks at the beginning of your turn 
 6. Brings up this rulebook interface during play"$%"Each stick has one rounded side and one flat side, which you can think of like the “heads” and “tails” of a coin. When counting the sticks, “heads” is worth 1, while “tails” is 0. The sticks are counted in two groups: 3 light sticks, and 3 dark sticks.
 -Liu He"$%To move, first <b>select a piece by clicking on it</b>. This will highlight the piece in blue. Next, <b>click on one of your move numbers</b> below your player card. Once you have selected a piece and a move number, all <b>valid destinations</b> on the board will be highlighted in gold. Click on one of these destinations to move your piece there.$%"You may show this diagram during gameplay by clicking <b>""Show lines""</b> in the lower left corner of the screen. Additionally, you can examine the board from other angles by rotating the camera; to do so, use the left and right arrow keys, or the Q and E keys."$%Owls are the only pieces that can score in nests, but they are also more valuable to capture. There is no limit to the number of Owls you can have at once.$%The pieces of a blockade stack on top of each other. Because blockades can be made of any combination of Owls and normal birds, there are three different ways they can look (see video above). However, all of these blockades work exactly the same way.$%Once a third bird enters a contested perch, the two of the same color will form a blockade, and the odd bird out will be <b>captured</b>. This is also called a <b>blockade capture</b>.$%Capture Type 1: Moving a <b>normal bird onto an Owl’s perch</b> immediately <b>captures the Owl</b>.$%Technicality: Only Owls may enter nest spaces. However, normal birds can always exit nest spaces. This is important because the Owl reverts to being a normal bird as soon as it enters the nest!$%"<b>Tip #2: Use the whole board.</b> Send some of your birds into the middle, while moving others around the outside. This way you can set up more possible landing areas for your owl, and your opponent will be less able to block you.

"Owls can score points by dropping their fish into nests on the opponent’s side of the board. However, you can also score points by capturing your opponent’s normal birds or Owls, which is often the faster path to victory.
 <b>The first player to 6 points wins!</b>"$%<b>Step 2</b>. <b>Click on a piece</b> to move, and <b>click on one of the numbers</b> you rolled. You may click the piece and the number in either order. You can deselect by using the escape key or right mouse button.$%You can use the arrow keys, or the Q and E keys, to rotate the camera around the game board.$%"The value of each group is equal to the number of “heads” rolled. However, rolling all “tails” is actually worth 4! This method of rolling results in 1 and 2 being three times as likely as 3 and 4. Rolling big numbers is a special event in Liubo!
 -Liu He"$%Hovering your mouse over one of these destinations will <b>preview the path</b> your piece would take to get there. This can be important to know if your piece will become an Owl or cross a nest during this movement.$%"The board consists of an <b>outer ring</b> of perches representing a <b>forest</b>, and 4 paths into a <b>central garden</b>, with the <b>pond</b> at the very center. The <b>nest</b> spaces are connected to the ""branch"" and ""hollow"" spaces at each corner. Only Owls may enter nests, and only the two nests on their <b>opponent’s side of the board</b>."$%A bird becomes an Owl as soon as it enters the pond as part of a movement. This means that it is impossible to capture an Owl standing in the middle using a single normal bird–it will become an Owl as soon as it enters the space.$%<b>Special Rule</b>: When rolling doubles, you cannot move both pieces of a blockade to the same new space. They can both move, but they must move to two different spaces.$%<b>A contested perch is not a blockade</b>. They do not prevent other birds from moving through them.$%Capture Type 2: Moving an <b>Owl onto a normal bird’s perch</b> immediately <b>captures the normal bird</b>.$%$%"<b>Tip #3: Your birds must work together.</b> Two or three birds close together are more likely to create a blockade or capture an opponent at a cruical moment. A bird all by itself won't be able to do this. Birds of a feather flock together!

"Hello friend! I am Liu He, former emperor and famous Han dynasty Liubo player! I was also known as Haihun Hou (the Marquis of Haihun). The last pages of each section contain my notes about the game and its history. 
 -Liu He"$%<b>Step 3</b>. Click on one of the highlighted <b>destination spaces</b> to move your piece$%"The game's components are historically acurate, and based on findings from excavated tombs, such as my own! The board and pieces and were frequently made of materials such as jade, ivory, and lacquered wood, while the throwing sticks were made of bamboo around metal rods.
 -Liu He"$%"This method of reading sticks is related to traditional divination methods, particuarly the trigrams and hexagrams found in the the <i>Yi Jing (Book of Changes).</i>
 
 -Liu He"$%"Like in many Chinese board games, your pieces stand on the lines of the board, rather than on ""spaces"" between them. In this case, the Liubo board represents a forest surrounding a walled garden, and the lines represent places your birds can perch in this environment.
 
 -Liu He"$%"The Outer Ring is the fastest path around the board! Try sending some bird around the outside, while another goes through the middle to become an Owl. The normal birds will reach the other side first, and help provide safe perches for your Owl to land.
 -Liu He"$%"Having too many Owls at once is risky! While you have more pieces able to score in nests, you are also providing your opponent many opportunities to score by capturing your Owls. Make all your pieces work together to keep your Owls safe.
 -Liu He"$%"The blockade mechanic is inspired by one of Liubo’s likely predecessors: the Indian game Pachisi. You may know it better by the name Parcheesi.
 
 -Liu He"$%"Be careful contesting perches too often. It can be a good way to set up captures on your next turn, but you are also presenting your opponent an opporunity to capture in the meantime.
 
 -Liu He"$%Capture Type 3: Moving <b>any bird onto a contested perch</b> immediately <b>captures the opponent’s bird</b> on that space. Additionally, your two pieces form a blockade on that perch.$%$%"<b>Tip #4: Owls need support.</b> Owls by themselves are likely to be captured. Try placing several normal birds on perches between the pond and the nest you want to score in before moving your Owl. This way you provide several possible blockade locations, creating a ""road"" of safe places for your Owl to land on the way to the nest.

 <b>You must always move two pieces</b>. You cannot move the same piece twice in one turn. You cannot “pass” your turn without finishing both moves."$%$%$%$%"Each perch has a name representing its place in the forest and garden portrayed by the board. Not all of the ancient Chinese characters have a direct translation into modern Chinese or English, so this set of names is an approximation that fits the theme.
 -Liu He"$%"In Liubo, the word used for “Owl” also means “leader.” So, when a bird becomes an Owl in the game, it is not literally transforming form one species of bird to another. Instead, it has earned the right to be called “leader” of the other birds by successfully catching a fish from the pond.
 -Liu He"$%$%$%Captured birds are moved off the board, but returned to their player; that player may re-enter their bird from a starting space on their next turn. Additionally, captured Owls are downgraded back to normal birds.$%$%"<b>Tip #5: Understand the sticks.</b> Rolls of 1 and 2 are three times more likely than 3 and 4.

$%When two of your birds share a perch, they form a <b>blockade</b>. This prevents all other birds from landing on or moving through this perch.$%$%$%$%"The pattern of lines on the Liubo board comes from traditional bronze mirrors of the Han dynasty, also known as the TLV pattern. In one interpretation, the central square represents the earth, the connected “T” shapes represent the sky, the four circles represent the seas, and the Ls and Vs around the outer edge represent the cosmos.
